## A short introduction
Bohar Singh is a climate scientist at IRI of Columbia University. His research is focused in understanding the variability of the climate system and to investigate its predictability at different time scales. Another particular area of his research is to explore the atmospheric and oceanic teleconnection pattern. Bohar is also interested in understanding cross time scale interactions between low frequency variabilities of the climate system such as El Niño Southern Oscillations (ENSO), Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) and Madden Julian Oscillations (MJO) and their role in sub-seasonal to seasonal climate prediction.

At IRI, Bohar is responsible for research and development in IRI’s sub-seasonal forecast system.
