## A short introduction
Dr. Muhammad Azhar Ehsan (He/Him) is an Associate Research Scientist at IRI, focusing on climate variations and prediction at multiple timescales (Weeks to Years). He leads the IRI Climate Forecast and ENSO Briefing every month. A primary objective of Azhar’s research work is to better understand the sensitivity of regional climates to changing sea surface temperature patterns, finding sources of predictability, and study physical processes that underpin regional hydroclimatic situations using observations and model datasets. His current regional foci include the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia.

He held postdoctoral and researcher positions, at the International Center for Theoretical Physics (ICTP), Trieste Italy, Center of Excellence for Climate Change Research (CECCR), Jeddah Saudi Arabia, and Global Change Impacts Studies Center, Islamabad Pakistan prior to joining the IRI in 2019.
