<strong>Oksana Grente</strong> (PhD 2018-2021) is evaluating the impact of lethal control on the French wolf population, with a special interest in social structure and livestock depredation. She will also develop an  adaptive management framework based on occupancy models. This is joint work with Christophe Duchamp and Nolwenn Hoguet-Drouet from

<strong>Mónia Nakamura Mercier Real</strong> (PhD 2019-2024) is investigating the impacts of anthropogenic factors on large carnivores persistence in human-dominated landscapes. She uses wolf in Spain and Portugal as a model species to address how different humanization levels can influence habitat selection and land use, and ultimately affect its demography, status and viability. The thesis is co-supervised with
